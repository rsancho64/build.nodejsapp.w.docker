In this tutorial, you will create an application image for a static website that uses the Express and Bootstrap frameworks. You will then build a container using that image and push it to Docker Hub for future use. Finally, you will pull the stored image from your Docker Hub repository and build another container, demonstrating how you can recreate and scale your application.
